- Add optional zeroize support
- Add optional quickcheck support
- Add optional valuable support
- Make integers #[repr(transparent)].
- Make Slice struct #[repr(transparent)].
- Performance enhancement for `shr` methods
- Make wrapping_rem panic message same as for primitives
- Breaking: make unchecked_shl, unchecked_shr take u32 as shift argument, not Self.
- **NOTE**: the previous implementation of unchecked_shl, unchecked_shr for 64 digit integers was incorrect, it has now been fixed.
- Fixed incorrect implementation of Add<Digit> for all BUints
- Fixed lcm implementation to not panic if self is zero
